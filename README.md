# Analysing-Cardio-Good-Fitness

In this project, I conducted an analysis using data from Cardio Good Fitness, a company that specializes in selling treadmills. The purpose of the analysis was to explore the relationship between sales and various factors, including gender, marital status, age, employment status, smoking habits, and drinking habits. By examining these factors, the goal was to identify potential opportunities to enhance the company's sales performance.
